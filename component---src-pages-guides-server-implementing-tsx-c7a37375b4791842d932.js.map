Types! While you still access <FixedFont>params</FixedFont>,{' '}\n                    <FixedFont>query</FixedFont> and <FixedFont>body</FixedFont> from the request as you would with express, everything is\n                    typed. You cannot access query and path parameters that do not exist, the body has an explicit type, and even the value\n                    you return as the response is typed to ensure that whatever you return matches the declaration.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    The implementation is given three parameters: the express request modified for types, express response and the\n                    declaration for the route that is being implemented. The declaration is more useful in middleware, but sometimes you can\n                    re-use implementations for multiple routes in which case it can be useful to be able to access the route options and to\n                    construct an URL to the same API, with different parameters.\n                  </p>\n                </>\n              )\n            },\n            {\n              heading: 'Passing the input data to other functions',\n              anchor: 'passingdata',\n              content: (\n                <>\n                  <p>It is often beneficial to split an implementation into multiple functions. But that can cause tricky type issues.</p>\n                  <Example>{`\n                complexAPI.implement(myImplementation)\n\n                function myImplementation(req: ??): ?? {\n                  // What are the types here meant to be?\n                }\n                `}</Example>\n                  <p>\n                    A simple but somewhat naive way to solve this problem would be to copy the types from the API declaration. If things\n                    don't match, typescript compiler will give you error messages and that'll work. But doing so can cause a bunch of extra\n                    work whenever things change, since there can be many types that need to be changed.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    The smart way in most cases is to use types provided by papupata. Since objects cannot export types the syntax is a bit\n                    odd as <FixedFont>typeof</FixedFont> is needed, but there does not seem to be a cleaner way to handle this.\n                  </p>\n                  <Example>{`\n                complexAPI.implement(myImplementation)\n\n                function myImplementation(req: typeof complexAPI.RequestType): typeof complexAPI.ResponseType {\n                  // Now we have explicit types!\n                }\n                `}</Example>\n                  <p>\n                    For more information about accessing data about the APIs, see <Link to={'/guides/metadata'}>the metadata guide</Link>\n                  </p>\n                </>\n              )\n            },\n            {\n              heading: 'Middleware',\n              anchor: 'middleware',\n              content: (\n                <>\n                  <p>\n                    You can not only configure an API declaration to include middleware that is applied to all APIs within it, but\n                    individual APIs can have their own middleware as well. Both express and papupata middleware are supported; when both are\n                    present, express middleware is always run first. If this is a problem, it is easy to create a wrapper that runs express\n                    middeware as papupata middleware.\n                  </p>\n                  <Example>{`\n                  complexAPI.implementWithExpressMiddleware([handleAuthentication], implementation)\n                  complexAPI.implementWithPapupataMiddleware([logRequests], implementation)\n                  complexAPI.implementWithMiddleware({\n                    express: [handleAuthentication],\n                    papupata: [logRequests]\n                  }, implementation)\n                  `}</Example>\n                  <p>\n                    See <Link to=\"/guides/server/middleware\">the middleware guide</Link> for more information about middleware.\n                  </p>\n                </>\n              )\n            },\n            {\n              heading: 'Not actually implementing routes',\n              anchor: 'notimplementing',\n              content: (\n                <>\n                  <p>\n                    Sometimes routing can work in ways where there are false positives. You might for example only want to run API actions\n                    with certain headers present, such as\n                  </p>\n                  <Example>{`\n                  Accept: application/json\n                `}</Example>\n                  <p>\n                    Usually you'd want to do this kind of filtering with a middleware, but perhaps you have an API with unique behavior. You\n                    can have the implementation indicate that routing should be restarted past the API you are in, accomplishing what you\n                    can with express by calling <FixedFont>next</FixedFont> in the implementation.\n                  </p>\n                  <Example>{`\n                    import {skipHandlingRoute} from 'papupata'\n                    complexAPI.implement(req => {\n                      if (!req.headers['accept']?.includes('application/json')) {\n                        return skipHandlingRoute\n                      }\n                      // actual implementation here\n                    }\n                  `}</Example>\n                </>\n              )\n            },\n            {\n              heading: 'Error handling',\n              anchor: 'errorhandling',\n              content: (\n                <>\n                  <p>\n                    Papupata does not do much in terms of error handling.
